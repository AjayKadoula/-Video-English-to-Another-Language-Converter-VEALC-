### -Video-English-to-Another-Language-Converter-VEALC-

A lot of videos over the Internet are only in English. Though English is our International language but a lot portion of the population of the world does not know English or are not good enough to understand that precisely. So they are then restricted to access the bunch of information over the Internet. They cannot see the Hollywood movies unless they are dubbed plus cannot gain knowledge by the video lectures on the YouTube.    Dubbing of the Hollywood movies or the movies of some other film industry take a lot of time along with a lot of money charged by the people giving their voice to that movie in another language



• One Language video can convert into another language.

• WaveNet (deep neural network for mimic), speech_recognition, Google Translator

• First Order Motion Model (Deep Fake).
